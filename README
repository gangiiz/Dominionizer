------------
A simple Dominion card randomizer for iOS with a focus on looking nice
(I tried anyway).

TODO:
-----------
- Fix UIWebView loading so you don't see it flicker into place
- Add bolding to card rules
- Add BlackMarket deck functionality
- Add "Young Witch" bane card picking ability in the detail view
- Set git commit ID on build. Currently disabled until
  Xcode is fixed.
- Use white at tear edges instead of partial transparency.
